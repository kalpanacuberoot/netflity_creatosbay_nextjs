                                    👋 Hi I’m Ben Low, Lead Experience Designer based in Perth, Western Australia. Firstly, thanks for looking at this file! I’m stoked you’ve taken the time to explore it further. I hope you learn something new from it 🙌.

                                    I’ve set myself a goal. To give back to the design community which I’ve learnt so much from over the past 10+ years. I am motivated to help you and others learn and upskill their UX/UI skills to take them to the next level 🚀.

                                    I put in a lot of time and effort making simple design files that are well structured, leverage Figma’s updates and are easy for you change to suit your needs.

                                    If you like this work, and want to see more, drop a ❤️ for this file in the Figma Community. If you’re feeling really generous, you can buy me a coffee @benlow244

                                    For any new file suggestions, questions or feedback, follow me on twitter @benlow24.
